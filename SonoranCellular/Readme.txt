Design considerations:
Since the “add a plan” page does not specify for new phones or plans to be added, we assume that those phones already exist in the database, and the fields aid the user in filling out the form.
We assume that “billing period” means a day, rather than a stretch of time.

Extra features:
Plans are fetched in a drop-down menu.
If there are no existing plans, ‘add a plan’ page shows a warning message.
The total for a billing period is printed in the “find-bills” page.
Accounts can register for dependents, but only if no one else is dependent on them.
Page for printing dependents.
